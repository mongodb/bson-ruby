Interface Conventions
---------------------

It is desirable to keep driver interfaces consistent when possible. Of
course, idioms vary by language, and when they do adaptation is
appropriate. However, when the idiom is the same, keeping the interfaces
consistent across drivers is desirable.

Terminology
-----------

In general, use these terms when naming identifiers. Adapt the names to
the normal "punctuation" style of your language -- ``foo_bar`` in C might be
``fooBar`` in Java.
