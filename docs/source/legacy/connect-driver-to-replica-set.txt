==================================
Connecting Drivers to Replica Sets
==================================

.. include:: /includes/note-legacy.rst

Ideally a MongoDB driver can connect to a cluster of servers which
represent a :term:`replica set`, and automatically find the right set
member with which to communicate. Failover should be automatic too. The
general steps are:

1. The user, when opening the connection, specifies ``host[:port]`` for one
   or more members of the set. Not all members need be specified. In
   fact the exact members of the set might change over time. This list
   for the connect call is the seed list.

2. The driver then connects to all servers on the seed list, perhaps in
   parallel to minimize connect time. Send an :dbcommand:`isMaster` command
   to each server.

3. When the server is in ``replSet`` mode, it will return a hosts field with
   all members of the set that are potentially eligible to serve data.
   The client should cache this information. Ideally this refreshes too,
   as the set's config could change over time.

4. Choose a server with which to communicate.

   - If ``ismaster == true``, that server is :term:`primary` for the set. This
     server can be used for writes and immediately consistent reads.

   - If ``secondary == true``, that server is not primary, but is available
     for eventually consistent reads. In this case, you can use the
     primary field to see which server the master should be. (If primary
     is not set, you may want to poll other nodes at random; it is
     conceivable that the member to which we are talking is partitioned
     from the other members, and thus it cannot determine who is primary
     on its own. This is unlikely but possible.)

5. If an error occurs with the current connection, find the new primary
   and resume use there.

For example, if we run the ismaster command on a non-primary server, we
might get something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.runCommand("ismaster")
   {
        "ismaster" : false,
        "secondary" : true,
        "hosts" : [
                "ny1.acme.com",
                "ny2.acme.com",
                "sf1.acme.com"
        ],
        "passives" : [
             "ny3.acme.com",
             "sf3.acme.com"
        ],
        "arbiters" : [
            "sf2.acme.com",
        ]
        "primary" : "ny2.acme.com",
        "ok" : true
   }

There are three servers with priority > 0 (``ny1``, ``ny2``, and ``sf1``), two
passive servers (``ny3`` and ``sf3``), and an arbiter (``sf2``). The primary should
be ``ny2``, but the driver should call :dbcommand:`isMaster` on that server before it
assumes it is.
