BSON [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mongodb/bson-ruby.png?branch=master&.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mongodb/bson-ruby) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mongodb/bson-ruby.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mongodb/bson-ruby) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mongodb/bson-ruby/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/mongodb/bson-ruby?branch=master)
====

An implementation of the BSON specification in Ruby.

Compatibility
-------------

BSON is tested against MRI (1.8.7+), JRuby (1.5.0+), Rubinius (2.0.0+), and REE.

Installation
------------

With bundler, add the `bson` gem to your `Gemfile`. As of 2.0.0 native extensions
are bundled with the `bson` gem and `bson_ext` is no longer needed.

```ruby
gem "bson", "~> 2.0"
```

Require the `bson` gem in your application.

```ruby
require "bson"
```

Usage
-----

### BSON Serialization

Getting a Ruby object's raw BSON representation is done by calling `to_bson`
on the Ruby object. For example:

```ruby
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day".to_bson
1024.to_bson
```

Generating an object from BSON is done via calling `from_bson` on the class
you wish to instantiate and passing it the `StringIO` bytes.

```ruby
String.from_bson(string_io)
Int32.from_bson(string_io)
```

Core Ruby object's that have representations in the BSON specification and
will have a `to_bson` method defined for them are:

- `Array`
- `FalseClass`
- `Float`
- `Hash`
- `Integer`
- `NilClass`
- `Regexp`
- `String`
- `Symbol` (deprecated)
- `Time`
- `TrueClass`

In addition to the core Ruby objects, BSON also provides some special types
specific to the specification:

#### `BSON::Binary`

This is a representation of binary data, and must provide the raw data and
a subtype when constructing.

```ruby
BSON::Binary.new(binary_data, :md5)
```

Valid subtypes are: `:generic`, `:function`, `:old`, `:uuid_old`, `:uuid`,
`:md5`, `:user`.

#### `BSON::Code`

Represents a string of Javascript code.

```ruby
BSON::Code.new("this.value = 5;")
```

#### `BSON::CodeWithScope`

Represents a string of Javascript code with a hash of values.

```ruby
BSON::CodeWithScope.new("this.value = age;", age: 5)
```

#### `BSON::Document`

This is a special ordered hash for use with Ruby below 1.9, and is simply
a subclass of a Ruby hash in 1.9 and higher.

```ruby
BSON::Document[:key, "value"]
BSON::Document.new
```

#### `BSON::MaxKey`

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare higher to another value.

```ruby
BSON::MaxKey.new
```

#### `BSON::MinKey`

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare lower to another value.

```ruby
BSON::MinKey.new
```

#### `BSON::ObjectId`

Represents a 12 byte unique identifier for an object on a given machine.

```ruby
BSON::ObjectId.new
```

#### `BSON::Timestamp`

Represents a special time with a start and increment value.

```ruby
BSON::Timestamp.new(5, 30)
```

#### `BSON::Undefined`

Represents a placeholder for a value that was not provided.

```ruby
BSON::Undefined.new
```

### JSON Serialization

Some BSON types have special representations in JSON. These are as follows
and will be automatically serialized in the form when calling `to_json` on
them.

- `BSON::Binary`: `{ "$binary" : "\x01", "$type" : "md5" }`
- `BSON::Code`: `{ "$code" : "this.v = 5 }`
- `BSON::CodeWithScope`: `{ "$code" : "this.v = value", "$scope" : { v => 5 }}`
- `BSON::MaxKey`: `{ "$maxKey" : 1 }`
- `BSON::MinKey`: `{ "$minKey" : 1 }`
- `BSON::ObjectId`: `{ "$oid" : "4e4d66343b39b68407000001" }`
- `BSON::Timestamp`: `{ "t" : 5, "i" : 30 }`
- `Regexp`: `{ "$regex" : "[abc]", "$options" : "i" }`
